# React \ API

Create a small application to search and obtain movie posters + imdb links using OMDB API [http://www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com)

An example result using a placeholder image is already placed on the application.

In order to complete this challenge, you must get an API KEY from omdb.com and use the search service API to get results. An example request could be

`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[ APIKEY ]&s=batman`

The displayed results should be limited to 15 movies.


Use what you think is best to get this working.

Rules:

* You may add other libraries if necesary.

* The final product should be responsive and work on any device.

* If this react project is not inside your confort zone, creating a new one form scratch is allowed. Even using a different framework.

Tips:

* Take advantage of react latest features and ES6.

* Test different search queries and resoltions.

* Its all about components. Use them.

* Find some tips on SCSS files.

* If you have questions related to the challenge, just ask.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
